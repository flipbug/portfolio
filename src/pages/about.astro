        Hi, my name is Daniel Milenkovic, currently based in Winterthur,
        Switzerland.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started this life in 1993 and from early on wished to become an
        architect. Plans change and during school I developed a proficiency for
        code, which led me into the world of programming and obtaining a
        bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Near the end of 2020 I rediscovered my passion for art, which turned
        into a beautiful journey exploring the human figure. I'm painting mostly
        traditionally with oil.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides art and programming my interests range from mythology to
        skateboarding and especially reading comics.
      </p>
