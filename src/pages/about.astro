        Hi, my name is Daniel Milenkovic, currently based in Winterthur,
        Switzerland.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started this life in 1993 and from early on wished to become an
        architect. Plans change and during school I developed a proficiency for
        code, which led me into the world of programming and obtaining a
        bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Near the end of 2020 I rediscovered my passion for art, which turned
        into a beautiful journey exploring the human figure. I'm painting mostly
        traditionally with oil. My artistic artistic path takes me primarily
        into the field of figurative art, whereby I focus mostly on traditional
        techniques such as oil painting and pencil drawings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each of my works is a window through my personal perspective of our
        shared reality. It is my goal through my art to to awaken new insights
        and connect with my emotions.
      </p>
